You'll have to click Next to proceed.

If you want to skip the final message, just click Next.

Step 19 
Add the program that you want to install. This is the EXE program that you created earlier. Click Browse, navigate to the file's location, click the file, and click Save.
You can also check the "Hide File Extracting Process Animation from User" box to ensure that the EXE installs without much visual input.
